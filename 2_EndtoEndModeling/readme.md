# Complete End-to-End Modeling with Deep Learning üß†üíª

## üìù Assignment:
As demonstrated in the class, complete three deep learning models in three separate Colab notebooks:
- **a) Classification**
- **b) Regression**
- **c) Image Classification**

Choose any problem for the above models but ensure thorough documentation and creation of all required artifacts. Provide summaries and deep learning model diagrams as shown in the exemplar Colab during the class.

### üìä Integration and Artifacts:
- Integrate with Weights & Biases (preferred) or TensorFlow TensorBoard.
- Provide all the artifacts and metrics as demonstrated in the class for each of the models:
  - **a) Classification Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score (per class and overall)
  - **b) Regression Metrics:** ROC and PR curves
  - **c) Image Classification Metrics:** Example images per class, per class error analysis, and all metrics

### üé• Video Submission:
Upload a short video doing a code walkthrough of the above three problems with detailed explanations of the metrics and error analysis, etc. Make sure to include all artifacts and outputs in the video.

#### Hint:
I've provided a number of Colabs for the same in the slide deck.
