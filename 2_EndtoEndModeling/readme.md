# Complete end2end Modeling with Deep Learning

## Assignment:
As demonstrated in the class, do three deep learning models in three colabs
* a) classification
* b) regression
* c) image classification

Using deep learning - pick any problem for above but be thorough on artifacts. Provide the summary and dl model diagrams as like in the colab i showed

Provide integration with weights and biases (preferred) or tensorflow tensorboard. Provide all the artifacts and metrics as shown in the class for each of above

* a) accuracy, precision, recall, f1 per class and overall

* b) roc and pr curves

* c) per class examples

* d) per class error analysis and all metrics

Upload a short video doing code walkthru of the above three problems with detailed explanations of above metrics and error analysis etc,.

make sure all the artifacts are uploaded with outputs

Hint: ive provided a number of colabs for the same in slide deck
