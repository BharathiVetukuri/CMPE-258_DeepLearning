### 📘 Solution

## 🔍 What are Tensors?  
Tensors are **multi-dimensional arrays** used in **machine learning** and **deep learning**. They generalize **scalars (0D), vectors (1D), matrices (2D), and higher-dimensional data structures**.


## 🔍 What are Einsum Operations?  
Einstein Summation (`einsum`) is a **powerful notation** for expressing tensor operations concisely. It enables **efficient computations** for **matrix multiplication, dot products, transpositions, summation, outer products**, and more.

## 🔍 Tensor Operations in TensorFlow
TensorFlow provides **efficient handling of tensors**, allowing operations like:
- **Creating tensors** (Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Higher-dimensional tensors).  
- **Basic tensor manipulations** – Indexing, Slicing, Reshaping, and Broadcasting.  
- **Math operations** – Addition, Multiplication, Dot Product, Matrix Multiplication.  
- **Advanced operations** – Softmax, Argmax, Reduce operations.  
- **Einsum operations** – Efficient matrix multiplications, element-wise operations, and batch processing.  

## 🔍 Tensor Operations in PyTorch
PyTorch provides **dynamic computation graphs** and efficient tensor operations, including:
- **Creating tensors** (Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, Higher-dimensional tensors).  
- **Basic operations** – Addition, Multiplication, Dot Product, Matrix Multiplication.  
- **Indexing and slicing** – Accessing tensor elements efficiently.
