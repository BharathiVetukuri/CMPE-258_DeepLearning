# DeepSeek

DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup that has developed open-source AI models. DeepSeek's models are said to be competitive with OpenAI's models, but at a lower cost. It has quickly emerged as a leader in text generation, reasoning, vision models, and image generation. DeepSeek recently launched state-of-the-art models, including Janus, a multimodal model capable of understanding visual data and generating images from text.

# DeepSeek Janus

DeepSeek Janus is a multimodal AI model that can understand and generate images and text. Janus is an innovative autoregressive framework that separates visual encoding into distinct pathways for understanding and generation tasks, while using a unified transformer architecture. This approach resolves conflicts between these roles, enhancing flexibility and effectiveness. Janus matches or surpasses task-specific models, making it a strong candidate for next-generation multimodal systems.

# DeepSeek R1

DeepSeek-R1 is a powerful reasoning model built for solving tasks that require advanced reasoning and deep problem-solving. It works great for coding challenges that go beyond regurgitating code that has been written thousands of times and logic-heavy questions.

What sets DeepSeek-R1 apart is its special use of reinforcement learning. To train R1, DeepSeek built on the foundation laid by V3, utilizing its extensive capabilities and large parameter space.One difference between V3 and R1 is that when chatting with R1, we don't immediately get a response. The model first uses chain-of-thought reasoning to think about the problem. Only once it finishes thinking it starts outputting the answer.
