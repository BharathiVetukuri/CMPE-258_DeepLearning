# CursorAI

Cursor AI is an AI-powered code editor designed to make software development easier. As a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), it retains the user-friendly interface and extensive ecosystem of VS Code, making it easier for developers already familiar with the platform to transition.

Cursor AI integrates advanced AI capabilities through OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT and Claude. This integration allows Cursor AI to offer intelligent code suggestions, automated error detection, and dynamic code optimization.

### Key Features

Cursor AI enhances developer productivity with a range of intelligent features:

- **Autocomplete and Code Prediction**: Speeds up coding by suggesting relevant code snippets and completing lines based on common patterns.
- **Code Generation**: Generates boilerplate code and complex code structures automatically.
- **Multi-line Edits**: Allows simultaneous editing of multiple lines of code, making widespread changes quick and easy.
- **Smart Rewrites**: Intelligently rewrites existing code to improve efficiency, readability, and maintainability.
- **Cursor Prediction**: Anticipates developer actions and suggests next steps, optimizing workflow and reducing keystrokes.
